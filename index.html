                    <p class="paragraph2">Having <a href="#">joined the air force</a>, Minhas was commissioned on March
                        13, 1971, in the
                        51st GD(P) Course.[8]
                        He began training to become a<a href="#"> pilot</a>. On <a href="#">August 20 of that year</a>,
                        in the hour before noon, he was
                        getting ready to <a href="#">take off</a> in a <a href="#">T-33 jet trainer </a>in <a
                            href="#">Karachi</a>, Pakistan. His second solo <a href="#">flight</a> in
                        that
                        type of <a href="#">aircraft</a>. <a href="#">Minhas </a>was taxiing toward the runway when a <a

                        <a href="#">Lieutenant Matiur Rahman</a>, signalled him to <a href="#">stop</a> and then climbed
                        into the <a href="#">instructor's seat</a>. The
                        <a href="#">jet</a>
                        took off and turned toward <a href="#">India</a>.</p><br><br>

                    <p class="paragraph2"> <a href="#">Minhas radioed PAF Base Masroor</a> with the message that he was
                        being <a href="#">hijacked</a>.
                        The air controller
                        requested that he <a href="#">resend his message</a>, and he confirmed the<a href="#">
                            hijacking</a>. Later <a href="#">investigation</a> showed
                        that Rahman intended to defect to <a href="#">India to join</a> his compatriots in the <a

                        <a href="#">War</a>,
                        along with the jet trainer. In the air, <a href="#">Minhas</a> struggled physically to wrest
                        control from
                        Rahman;
                        each man tried to <a href="#">overpower</a> the other through the mechanically linked flight
                        controls. Some <a href="#">32

                        (51 km) from the <a href="#">Indian border</a>, the jet crashed near <a href="#">Thatta</a>.
                        Both men were killed.[9]</p>

                    <p class="paragraph2"> Minhas was <a href="#">posthumously awarded Pakistan's top military

                        <a href="#">Nishan-E-Haider</a>, and became the
                        <a href="#">youngest man and the only member of the Pakistan Air Force to win the award</a>.
                        Similarly, Rahman
                        was
                        honoured by <a href="#">Bangladesh with their highest military</a> award, the Bir Sreshtho.[10]

                    <p class="paragraph2"> <a href="#">Minhas's Pakistan military</a> citation for the <a
                            href="#">Nishan-E-Haider states</a> that he
                        "forced the aircraft to
                        crash" in order to prevent Rahman from taking the jet to <a href="#">India.[9]</a> This is the
                        official, popular
                        and
                        widely known version of how <a href="#">Minhas died</a>. <a href="#">Yawar A. Mazhar</a>, a
                        writer for Pakistan Military
                        Consortium,
                        relayed in 2004 that he spoke to <a href="#">retired PAF Group Captain Cecil Chaudhry </a>about
                        Minhas, and that
                        he
                        learned more details not generally known to the public. According to Mazhar, Chaudhry lead the
                        immediate task of investigating the wreckage and writing the accident report. Chaudhry told
                        Mazhar
                        that he found the <a href="#">jet</a> had hit the ground nose first, instantly killing Minhas in
                        the front seat.
                        Rahman's body, however, was not in the jet and the canopy was missing. Chaudhry searched the
                        area
                        and saw <a href="#">Rahman's</a> body some distance behind the jet, the body found with severe
                        abrasions from
                        hitting the sand at a low angle and a high speed. Chaudhry thought that Minhas probably
                        jettisoned
                        the canopy at low altitude causing Rahman to be thrown from the cockpit because he was not
                        strapped
                        in. <a href="#">Chaudhry</a> felt that the jet was too close to the ground at that time, too far
                        out of control
                        for
                        <a href="#">Minhas to be able to prevent the crash</a>.[11] </p> <br><br>
